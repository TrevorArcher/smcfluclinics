TODO:

* Separate out languages so it's easier for a translator to work
  on just their own language. Perhaps ask translators to work in 
  CSV (Excel-able) with just two columns, english -> l10n, and 
  then make a small tool than can merge into a valid JSON file. 
  (Added benefit of that is to avoid silent jQuery errors if the
  JSON's invalid from hand-editing.)
  * Perhaps also a tool to scrape the HTML (and javascript?) to
    look for localization strings...
