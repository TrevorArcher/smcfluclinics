TODO:

* Separate out languages so it's easier for a translator to work
  on just their own language. Perhaps ask translators to work in 
  CSV (Excel-able) with just two columns, english -> l10n, and 
  then make a small tool than can merge into a valid JSON file. 
  (Added benefit of that is to avoid silent jQuery errors if the
  JSON's invalid from hand-editing.)
  * Perhaps also a tool to scrape the HTML (and javascript?) to
    look for localization strings...

* navigator.globalization.* is not working at all for me: callbacks
  never getting called, though I can see the globalization.js file
  is loading and debug into where it calls exec on cordova.  Once
  that works, will doubtless want to think about some enhanecments
  to the globalization callback --- it's supposed to take a language
  object with a .lang property, and language for Spanish might be
  well be "Espa√±ol" rather than "Spanish."
  But until the callback gets invoked...

* Google map has four(+?) pieces of text that are not getting localized:
  Map, Satellite, Terrain and Labels. Google might well localize those
  themselves if the phone is in another locale, but it's worth looking
  at once navigator.localization works.
