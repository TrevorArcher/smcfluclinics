<h1>Testing the OpenSMC Flu Clinic App
</h1>
<p>Requirements:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Android phone or iOS phone</li>
<li>Working Cordova build environment</li>
</ol>

<h2>Basic Tests
</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Open App, confirm map centered on San Mateo County appears.</li>
  <li>Confirm there's a menu bar in green across the top, with icon for
      menu (three stacked bars) on the left and information (circled i)
      on the right.</li>
  <li>Scroll up agressively at the very bottom of the screen, trying to
      grab the bottom-most pixel. Also scroll agressively at the the top-most
      pixel of the map and bottom of the menu. Confirm the menu does not
      "scroll up" off the web page.</li> 
  <li>Open the menu by clicking the three stacked bars.
    <ol>
    <li>Confirm there's a picklist with a range of dates.</li>
    <li>Confirm there's a picklist of languages (temporarily) for testing.</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
  <li>Use the menu's picklist of dates to pick "all time" to have some
      valid clinic choices.</li>
  <li>Flick the menu to the left and confirm it closes.</li>
  <li>Confirm map shows a lot of clinics (small white icons with red crosses).</li>
  <li>Click on a clinic icon to see the clinic details
    <ol>
    <li>Confirm details appear.</li>
    <li>Confirm the clinic date(s) fit into the chosen date range.</li>
    <li>Note the clinic's address for subsequent steps.</li>
    </ol></li>
  <li>Click on the "view on map" link to confim it opens Google Maps 
      (or other preferred application), for the clinic address from above.</li>
  <li>Close Google Maps (or other application) and return to app. Confirm
      the clinic details page (re)appears with the same content as before.</li>
  <li>Go back to the map. Confirm you see the clinic(s).</li>
  <li>Zoom into the clinic selected earlier and verify the location on the map
      matches (or is at least plausibly close to) the street address of the clinic.</li>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Translation Tests
</h2>

<p>Note: many tests can be done with a pre-release app that has a
   language-picking menu. But at least a final round of testing needs
   to be done by changing the settings menu for the phone as a whole
   to put the whole phone in another language. That's required to
   confirm the app starts in the right language, and to confirm that
   the Google maps code has the right language.
</p>

<p>Missing translations will appear with messages like 
   "ERROR: 'Spanish' translation not found for <i>thing</i>"</tt>.
   Look for those.
</p>
<ol>
<li>For each language (English, Chinese, Spanish):
  <ol>
  <li>Open menu, and confirm all menu title are in selected language.</li>
  <li>Open each picklist, and confirm each picklist entry is in the native
      language (except language names themselves, if the pick-a-language
      choice is in the menu).</li>
  <li>Open a clinic. Confirm all the text is in the selected language.</li>
  <li>Open the information page. Confirm all the text is in the selected language.</li>
  <li>Look at the map itself. Google provides menus for maps vs satellite, with
      checkboxes for Terrain and Labels, respectively. If the language was picked
      from the phone's settings, these lables should be in the selected language.
      (If the language was set in the app, the Google map text will remain in the
      phone's language.)</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
